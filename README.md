My flappy bird clone

Sleepy Bird

This is my attempt at a flappy bird clone called Sleepy Bird. Game was created using C# in Monogame. The goal of the game is to fly Sleep Bird through as many of the obstacle as possible.

Motivation

I created this game to further my C# knowledge and to put this game on my C.V. 

Build
